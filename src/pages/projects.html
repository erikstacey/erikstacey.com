    A python program for performing frequency analyses of photometric observations of massive stars. This was originally written to perform the analysis in my thesis, however was also found to be suitable for general application with photometric observations
    of massive stars. At the core of PyPW is a sophisticated multi-stage iterative pre-whitening algorithm, which matches or exceeds the accuracy of similar tools (e.g. <a href="http://period04.net/">Period04</a>). This program also fully
    automates the frequency analysis procedure, including error and significance analyses, which reduces the analysis time by up to 80% compared to a manual tool.

    A high-altitude balloon mission successfully built and flown as a part of the NSERC CREATE International Space Mission Training Program. The payload was principally designed to collected temperature and humidity data as a function of altitude, and included
    imaging instrumentation facing toward the horizon and up towards the balloon (Image: the helium balloon imaged from the payload moments after burst at 33km altitude). I led a team of five which wrote the software for the onboard computer and instrumentation.
    I also designed and constructed the electrical power system with another collaborator.

<h3>(WIP, 2023) PrintSFF</h3>
<p>
    An 11L small form factor (SFF) personal computer case which can be constructed from 3D printed parts and a small quantity of locally-sourced sheet aluminum. 
    The prototype design efficiently packs a full ATX motherboard and a video card up to 3 slots in thickness and 325 mm in length, both significant challenges in commercially-available SFF PC cases, while occupying a 32 cm x 34 cm x 9.5 cm volume.
    Furthermore, the 3D printed parts will individually fit into an (18 cm)^3 print volume, permitting printing on small form factor printers (e.g. Prusa MINI/MINI+). This design will be made publicly available on github upon completion.
