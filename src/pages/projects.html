<p style="margin-bottom:120px;">
    A flexible python package for conducting Lomb-Scargle-based pre-whitening of time series data. It is distinguished from other, similar tools by a focus on automated pipeline-style analysis and a high degree of flexibility through its extensive configuration system. 
    The core functionality of this package (which I originally called PyPW) was written to conduct the comprehensive frequency analysis in my MSc thesis, however it was noted during my defence that this would be a more broadly applicable tool and therefore I've converted it to a Python package.

<p style="margin-bottom:120px;">
    A high-altitude balloon mission successfully built and flown as a part of the NSERC CREATE International Space Mission Training Program. The payload was principally designed to collected temperature and humidity data as a function of altitude, and included
    imaging instrumentation facing toward the horizon and up towards the balloon (Image: the helium balloon imaged from the payload moments after burst at 33km altitude). I led a team of five which wrote the <a href="https://github.com/ivansavytskyy/phys5492022"> software</a> for the onboard computer and instrumentation.
    I also designed and constructed the electrical power system with another collaborator.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/erikstacey/phmin">phmin (Python Package)</a></h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:120px;">
    A small python package for performing frequency analysis on time series data using a phase dispersion minimization method. While principally designed and utilized for sparse photometric observations of stars, this package makes no (astronomical) assumptions about
    the input data and is therefore generally suitable for time series analysis of sparse data, particularly where non-sinusoidal signals are present.

    This is a passion project to create a sci-fi building and simulation game, which is currently in the early stages of development. I've undertaken this both to learn about optimization, real-time systems, and video game development, as well as build an interesting and innovative game. It is currently in the early stages of the development, and I'm building the core game architecure on top of SDL2 in C++.
