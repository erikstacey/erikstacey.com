<p style="margin-bottom:120px;">
    A python package for performing frequency analyses of photometric observations of massive stars. The core functionality of this program was originally written to perform the analysis in my thesis, however was also found to be suitable for general application with photometric observations. At the core of pywhiten is a sophisticated multi-stage iterative pre-whitening algorithm, which matches or exceeds the accuracy of similar tools (e.g. <a href="http://period04.net/">Period04</a>). This program also fully
    automates the frequency analysis procedure, including error and significance analyses, which reduces the analysis time by up to 80% compared to a manual tool.

<p style="margin-bottom:120px;">
    A high-altitude balloon mission successfully built and flown as a part of the NSERC CREATE International Space Mission Training Program. The payload was principally designed to collected temperature and humidity data as a function of altitude, and included
    imaging instrumentation facing toward the horizon and up towards the balloon (Image: the helium balloon imaged from the payload moments after burst at 33km altitude). I led a team of five which wrote the software for the onboard computer and instrumentation.
    I also designed and constructed the electrical power system with another collaborator.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/erikstacey/phmin">phmin (Python Package)</a></h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:120px;">
    A small python package for performing frequency analysis on time series data using a phase dispersion minimization method. While principally designed and utilized for sparse photometric observations of stars, this package makes no (astronomical) assumptions about
    the input data and is therefore generally suitable for time series analysis of sparse data, particularly where non-sinusoidal signals are present.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/erikstacey/FLDCRV-GRID">FLDCRV-GRID (Fortran Program)</a></h3>
<p style="margin-bottom:120px;">
    A Fortran program based on a 1986 FORTRAN77 program FLDCRV, originally authored by John Landstreet. This program utilizes the core functionality of FLDCRV, which models the apparant longitudinal magnetic field of a magnetic star at given rotational phases
    given a set of physical and geometric parameters, while greatly improving useability and adding the ability to compute models and compare with observations simultaneously.
