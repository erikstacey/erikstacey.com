    I grew up in the coastal mountains of British Columbia, in the town of Pemberton, BC, where I lived on a small farm with my family. After graduating high school, I moved to Kingston, ON 
    after graduation to begin studies at Queen's University and in 2020 I was awarded a Bachelor of Science (Hons.) degree in astrophysics. I started graduate studies at the Royal Military College of Canada under the prestigious NSERC CREATE
    International Space Mission Training Program, which I completed in 2022 and was awarded a Master of Science degree in physics. My research as a graduate student focused on analyzing photometric and spectroscopic observations of rare magnetic O- and B-type stars. Particularly, I examined anomalous magnetic binary systems
    in pursuit of insights into the origin of magnetism in massive stars.

    My professional interests are currently in software development and data analysis. I have particular experience with developing streamlined scientific analysis tools which improve data processing efficiency, ensure analytical consistency,
    and remove opportunities for human error. I'm currently seeking to leverage this experience to transition into a career of commercial software development and data analysis.

    My personal interests lie in the realm of designing and building electronic/electromechanical systems. I'm particularly interested in low-cost at-home manufacturing devices (e.g. 3D printers, CNC mills), 
    custom desktop computer hardware, and personal transportation. Outside of tinkering, I enjoy longboarding, downhill skiing, and snowmobiling.
