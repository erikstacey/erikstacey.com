    I grew up in the coastal mountains of British Columbia, in the town of Pemberton, BC, where I lived on a small farm with my family. After graduating high school, I moved to Kingston, ON to begin studies at Queen's University and in 2020 I was awarded a Bachelor of Science (Hons.) degree in astrophysics. I started graduate studies at the Royal Military College of Canada under the prestigious NSERC CREATE
    International Space Mission Training Program, which I completed in 2022 and was awarded a Master of Science degree in physics. My research as a graduate student focused on analyzing photometric and spectroscopic observations of rare magnetic O- and B-type stars. Particularly, I examined anomalous magnetic binary systems
    in pursuit of insights into the origin of magnetism in massive stars.

    Professionally, I'm interested in the realm of software development, data analysis, and systems engineering. I find these fields align well with my personal interests and professional experience, and also provide a steady stream of interesting an unique problems to develop solutions for. Problem solving is a significant part of my personal motivation as I find great pleasure in the process of sitting down with a set of resources, a set of constraints, and an objective to address.

    I have a diverse array of personal interests and like to keep many (too many) hobby projects to learn new skills and solve interesting problems. Relating to software development, I'm particularly interested in game programming as the complex, real-time, interactive nature of video games makes for some interesting program structures (and I like video games!). Otherwise, I like designing and building my own electronic, mechanical, or electromechanical devices.
